"I was too young to even realise that what was happening to was wrong. My elder cousin brother use to tell me that it's just a game and a part of playing house, and then he use to touch me the wrong way and grope me and assault me. It went on for months. Luckily, due to a family feud, my cousin left our house along with his family and I never had to see him again. It was only when I grew up that I realised that I was being molested for months by own cousin brother. I am from a well educated and a well to do family. Half my family is in defence and military. We live in the urban area in varanasi, and yet something like this happened to me and no one knows.

"I was in Bandra to meet my friends, took a rickshaw from the station. At the signal, the rickshaw driver stopped and turned around to talk to me. Then he pointed to my nose, and told me there was something on it. I got really confused, I touched my nose, couldn't feel anything out of the ordinary. I was doing that, and then suddenly he said ""No no, it's here"" and leaned in and proceeded to SQUEEZE my nose. Literally pinched my nostrils. I was so not expecting that. Was just sitting stunned for a second. Like what just happened? Then the traffic lights turned green and he started driving again. I noticed he kept looking at me from the mirror. Got so scared. I tried just breathing from my mouth for the remainder of the journey. I was quite shocked. I texted my friend his number plate and everything, in case he was trying to drug and kidnap me or something. Then finally, when I reached the destination and was paying and getting off, he says ""Oh did you find what it was on your nose then?"" I said No... Then he almost reached out to touch my nose again. And I just backed away and gave him a glare, so he stopped. Then he said ""It must have been a nose hair, don't you remove them?"" and I was still confused, because it all felt so absurd. He drove off then. I don't know what he was up to. There was definitely no nose hair, not that he could see a tiny hair from such a far distance. And it could just be me, but I think I saw him reach into something kept below before he turned around and proceeded to pinch my nose. I was just so shaken and scared the whole time. Thought I might actually not make it home. number plate. Number plate MH 02 EW 1141",Touching /Groping

"In last one week as everyone knows that in different regions of haryana 14 rapecases has occurred involving girls from 3years onwards to aged ones.And on the other hand people are protesting against the release of padmavaat.I mean it's shameful that youngsters are wasting their time as well as their power in such issues.Are these rape cases acceptable? And the movie which is based on fiction too is too much important for everyone to raise this issue.Rape cases must be the concern of Haryana government.It is like no girl is safe at any place either at their home,in school,in colleges and not even at their workplaces.Is this our democratic India?? I think no here the democracy is only for the rapists and the culprits. I am also a girl and I also stay away from my home for studies. There are times when I feel so unsafe while walking at the roadside or in the market. Is their any gender equality in India? We talk about gender equality and things like that girls can do everything that boys do but it's incorrect girls can't do such inhuman acts that boys do and where is our government ,where is our law what they are doing for girls.

I was travelling with my family and we were in Gurgaon. A girl with a boy came on bike and the girl was wearing croptop and jeans. Two boys in a car came behind them and we all stopped on traffic signal and those boys were smoking cigarettes. When the boys saw the girl they put their burning cigarettes inside the jeans of the girl from back side and ran away and the girl was screaming of pain. I noticed the people standing over there saying that it was the fault of the girl as she was wearing short clothes and her body was uncovered. I mean this was seriously so shameful and ridiculous. Instead of showing sympathy towards that girl everyone standing there was blaming her and her dressing sense. Why don't you teach your sons to behave in respectful manner? One similar incindent happened with me when I was in 5th standard i was wearing short top and skirt and went to my neighbours house with my mom. There my aunt told my mom to not allow me to wear these kind of clothes as this will affect their daughters thinking. I mean are u guys serious one side you talk about modern India modern society and development and on the other side you are still carrying this orthodox thinking of yours that girls should be covered. I want to ask all the girls that don't u think babes these guys need to change their thinking and not us to change our dressing style,Touching /Groping

"I was going to work one afternoon and walking down the road near Maharaja Signal. I saw a group of many men around 10-15 men in this area. They all seemed like they were from the Northern Part of India. I was in a decent salwar kameez covered in a dupatta. One of the men in the group yelled at me saying ""I love you"" in a very demeaning manner. Again this seems to be politically motivated by the elite white skinned North Indians who consider themselves to be gods and goddesses whereas the brown skinned and black skinned South Indians are creeps and the evil witches of India The white skinned North Indian women are considered innocent and angels from heaven. The problem is because I am a brown skinned woman with blemishes on my skin. So I am called a creep. I wonder who the real creeps are? The men who catcall at the woman and the men who pass sexual advances at a woman at 8 pm in the night or the educated black skinned south indian women who are treated like ""naukraanis"" by the elite North Indians who consider themselves to be superior to other because of the color of their skin. I wonder who the real creeps are. The men who rape and inflict harm or who women get raped. I wonder who the real creeps are the people who treat women like objects of their sexual desire or the women who have the courage to step out of their homes to educate themselves and fight for their grades? Why doesn't these so called elite North Indians give their rapists a US visa and ask them to educate themselves in a foreign country if they have the courage instead of belittling black skinned South women who have made something out of themselves in the world?",Catcalls/Whistles

The second time happened on Saturday 13th August 2016 at 10:30 pm when I was walking near Wadala station and this biker stopped his bike right in front of me and started using different facial expressions. Thankfully my parents came to pick me up at that time. But the biker managed to get away before I could complain.

This  mostly happens during the afternoon at around 5:30- 6:00, though the timings diversify. A man stops at one of the shady location right in front of the Baithani high school and sometime it would be right outside Lakshmi park, he would try to seek attention or imbibe fear on the minds of people walking alongside the road and most of it would be done when a girl would pass by him. This are things which is considered not so normal in our society, things like opening your undergarments and showing your most private areas especially to young teenage girls. it happens most of the time in the evening when college going girls would come out of their hostel or pg's for a stroll.

It was a disproportionate backlash for our stand against street harassment. When I realized an angry mob was confronting us, I tried and called the police & women cell to no avail. Basically it seems that for these neighbours, standing peacefully but firmly against street harassment is a greater offence than street harassment itself :(",Ogling/Facial Expressions/Staring

Besides this, after exiting from the underground bridge and as you walk towards Shivar Guest House, there are always huge groups of men, including shop keepers sitting all along the wholesale clothes shops going towards the BMC Quaters, who not only make lewd remarks, they also make sexual remarks, and sometimes even attempt unwanted contact. Worse cases have been witnessed but no action has ever been taken. This is just not a fixed group, there are always gangs at this entire area and specially at nights, the lane towards Laxmi baug and the BMC Quarters has a lot of mini ladders where these gangs sit as soon sun sets, and the number increases as time passes and it becomes worse at nights.",Ogling/Facial Expressions/Staring

"Harassment is a blow any girl can suffer anywhere. Harassment is not necessarily an attack by just strangers, it can be an intense assault within the confinements of your house you considered your home. Here I am typing my own story of an account which shook my life and left it scarred in a way that I attest as irreversible. On an eventful Sunday, I returned home to an eerie silence. The tension in the air was palpable and the looks in the eyes of my dad were unmistakably of anger. I kept quiet and walked to my room, hoping that I was just worrying for no reason. I slouched on my bed with a slice of chocolate cake and tuned into my favorite channel on TV. Two hours later I was summoned by my Dad for a discussion and I knew at that very moment that all my fears will materialize in a span of few seconds. I come from a conservative family, where I am the only girl who is working in a corporate, who is career oriented, and independent in her thoughts and actions. Truly liberal and yet righteous in my thoughts, I have never questioned my approach towards life. I have been constantly put down by my family, I have incessantly been compared to my elder brother, my thoughts have been suppressed, and my ideals have been questioned. That night, my dad was furious for I was out on a Sunday with my friends for a social cause, in a mixed group of girls and guys, which was unacceptable to him; though God knows why he co-educated me; though God knows why despite being an educated man, his thoughts were shallow and hurtful as they demeaned women. He was in a rage that I was too independent for his governance and societal norms. He considered my independence and will to make a mark as insolence and immoral. He wanted me to be confined to the four walls of my house, preparing myself to get married without even realizing my dreams. As I sat there objecting, he asked for my phone and decided to cut me off from my social circle. He crushed my brand new phone to pieces and threw the broken pieces right at my face, the shattered screen leaving scratches wherever the tiny broken glasses pricked me. As I further relented, he hurled abuses and called me names a father can never associate with his own daughter. My tears had dried listening to it all, I was feeling stronger and motivated to not succumb to this harassment; this was the worst I had seen and somewhere it brought me to peace that I had already faced the worst. I constantly defended my education, my career, and my strong ideals against his baseless , autocratic, and barbaric thoughts. I would call it barbaric as I could have never imagined that my own father would move agitatedly around looking for a knife in the kitchen to further harm me. That just killed every emotion I could associate with a father-daughter relationship. I stood upto him and looked him in the eye and told him that this was the worst thing he could ever do and he shall never be forgiven. Our relationship ended that night and I haven’t spoken to him eversince. As I walked out of that room, and not that house, just for the sake of my mother, I wept endlessly in my room, not able to fathom what just happened to me and why. My dad’s extreme behavior, the silence of my mother, and the fear in my brother’s eyes made me realize how shallow our society is; how can we even call it a society where one’s life means nothing just because she is a girl. Who allows them to believe that women are weak or inferior?  There is absolutely no logic, no rationale, and absolutely no forgiveness for anyone who cannot respect a woman, be it our own parents. I know of so many girls who are living a far more dreadful existence and I have penned my story not for sympathy, not for appreciation for standing up for myself, but simply to encourage all the women and men reading this to propagate an understanding of how beautiful, divine, and amazing women are as god’s creation. I want us all to make a society where every woman is safe, happy, and successful; where every woman is an equal to every man. Do not cry, do not lose hopes, and do not deprive yourself of education as that is your true independence and absolute achievement. As we pin the creeps across the cities, and enlist all the crime spots around us, we need to realize that women are suffering at the hands of their own families. A true movement of women safety will begin when all the women stand up for themselves. Only when you respect yourself will the world respect you. Stay strong, stay safe!",Others

"Man standing between a schoolbus and a building wall on North Avenue in Santacruz (West); masturbating and exposing himself. It was pretty dark between wall and bus, and there are enough bushes to hide him from the watchmen who were just about 10-12 feet away. Initially it was unclear what he was up to owing to how dark it was. But when it did become more evident and I was about to call out to the watchmen he ran away. It's disturbing because there are kids living in the building and around it. This is also right on to a busy arterial lane between linking and sv road. The complete lack of fear of discovery on such a busy location is also disquieting.

I commute to Kurla from Kharghar daily and some perverts get on the train from Mankhurd and Govandi who not only pass lewd comments to every girl on the station. They do not differentiate between teenage girls or a woman in her late 40's their comments are alike and quite disturbing and fellow commuters say nothing to them. They get down at Kurla and then they start taking their chances while getting on the railway bridge. They always try to grope woman in pretex of crowd and other male passengers chose to ignore even after looking at the shameless act.I strongly feel that there should be separate bridge at all stations for women.,Ogling/Facial Expressions/Staring

The Tardeo Diana bridge is a very unsafe area especially afternoon times and on holidays. a lot of harassment and chain snatching incidents are happening very often as there are many escape routes especially towards the railway lines. Similarly the small lane below the bridge near Bai RFD Panday GIrls High School and the staircase from the bridge leading to the below parsi colony always has drug addicts and such types of people hanging around drinking and smoking drugs. The bridge is so unsafe that a debris truck since the last 3 - 4 years every month practically dumps an entire truck load of debris tight on the bridge and no body has yet caught him. Imagine what can happen to a woman in such an area....The main problem is that the bridge is divided into two police stations and perhaps neglected for the same reason.,Ogling/Facial Expressions/Staring

I gave a firm rude look but did not get into verbal fight as the lane was not lit. there were very few people passing by. The most surprising thing... I was dressed in Salwar Kameez on one occasion. Alert One - There is a cheap liqour shack prior Haware residential Project via the lane i was walking...the boys were heading in the same direction which means they either belong to the slums nearby or were heading to chill out at the liquor shack. Alert Two - The place ahead of the liqour shack is deserted ... I have noticed rickshaw drivers and other local boys frequenting this place. Liqour is consumed in open.....I have seen it. The road gets spilt in two directions one to haware proect.. the other heads to a valley like place which is deserted....police needs to have their presence felt here....

At a police checkpoint, I was confident but respectfully asked if they could have a lady officer checking my alcohol content on the breathalyser due to a prior shocking incident where the police pulled out my keys and made me blow into the breathalyser 4 times since they couldn't find alcohol on my breath. Of course, this time round I was smarter and more cautious and did not fall victim much prior to them repeating the horror...or so I thought! The inspector said that 'they will not touch me and feel me' so I should cooperate with them testing my breath. However, I found that disrespectful and did not lower the window. They then clamped my car and began to shoot a video. I waited for somebody I know to come and when that happened, used the breathalyser. Of course, the alcohol content was negative and they made me blow a second time. By this time, we argued to be let go and left the place. How are we to feel safe when the police themselves do not strive to instill that confidence in women? After all this, they say that women should not even be out on the streets after sundown!

"It was my first day in Bangalore(after spending 4 years in Delhi). My kitchen was not yet set up hence we(me and my male friend) went out for dinner to a restaurant which was located at a very central area. At about 10:30PM, we were done with our dinner and while heading towards my car which was parked about 500 meters from the restaurant, four men(looked like in their forties) started calling me out, saying 'excuse me', on turning towards them, they started teasing me, passing comments like 'miss you', 'hello' and all. My friend got furious with them but I somehow managed to convince him to get into the car and  We chose not to react. However, my friend asked me to stay inside the car and went out to note down their car number. These men seemed to notice him note down their car number, and after a while, they started man handling him. Fortunately I had a 'Naga chilly spray' with me. I took that out, ran towards them and managed to knock out three of them with the same. The fourth man got hold of my hand and pushed me down the road, and I hit my head. The saddest part was that people around were watching as if there is a drama being played on the road. Nobody came for help. While my friend was busy at the other end trying to fight with the rest of them, I saw one of the men take out iron rods from their car dickey. I pulled my friend telling him no one is gonna come for help and we will not be able to help ourselves either. We ran towards the car and immediately went inside. On turning the car to take a U-turn, two or three of them came running towards us with the intention to hit us, but since we were already inside, they smashed all sides of my car glasses. We rushed to the nearest police station asking for help. On showing them their car number(which my friend luckily noted down), the police personnel hesitated to file an FIR(As per our understanding, they seemed to be local/political goons residing in the same area. We left my car at the police station for the night, returned home at about 3AM in the morning and again went back to the police station for filing the FIR. After repeated failed request, we had to use my friend's position(he is in the army), we spoke to the head of that police station and filed the FIR. I was totally devastated from inside and wanted to leave Bangalore the very day. I cried the whole night and asked my friend to drop me home, maybe for a month, or two, or maybe forever, but I woke up the next day, and decided to fight this out. Being a woman living alone in the city, with 'different' looks and a car that these people can easily identify, I didn't want to get into the mess of making rounds at the police station, and court case(my friend also had to leave for work in few days), I decided to take back the FIR but also stay back in Bangalore and move on. We looked for a new house the very same day and I moved to a farther and safer house. It may be a question on someone's head as to why I withdrew the FIR and didn't try to punish those culprits. But we all know that the country that we live in. Even murderers are set free from punishment, leave aside eve teasers and people who made injury to us physically and damaged our property. This is a story, not only because I want to share one, but it shows how our own country has failed to protect its own citizens, a story of the faith that a woman doesn't have in her country's governing authority, a story that shows how we humans lag in being a helping hand when others are in need(yes, there were families watching the incident), a story to tell, that no matter how much hatred the world puts into you, you still need to have a love for humanity, a story, hoping that we(women) shall overcome from all these pain one day.....",North East India Report

"In the summer 2011 I stayed in Manju ka Tilla as I had just returned from Dharamshala. As a foreigner traveling alone,I would always stay in the guest houses here since the area felt safe. One morning at 9am, as I prepared to leave the guesthouse to take a train to Agra, I was cornered by an ear cleaner. It all happened very suddenly. He offered to clean my ears and when I said no, he pushed me against a wall of one of the side alleys just off the main street, and proceeded to touch my breasts and nipples. I somehow pushed him away and raced back to my guesthouse, but when the guy in reception ran out to try and find the ear cleaner, he was gone. Shocked and shaken up and upset as I was, I had a train to catch and headed down to New Delhi train station on a taxi. Once at the station, my driver called in a guy to help carry one of my bags. We agreed how much I would pay for this then and there, and he was meant to help me find my train. We reached the train and went into the 2AC section where I was traveling, which at the time was empty still. After putting down the bag he extended his hand to ask for more money. I said no and reached down for the agreed sum, by which time he started to feel up my thigh (and move up). I yelled back and told him to back off and get out! He then shook his head and said ok to the money, but when I gave him the rupees he grabbed my hand and put it on his erect penis. It was deeply disturbing. Luckily, as I was trying to free my hand from his grip, other people came into the train and he ran out the opposite end. That was 11 am. The people who traveled with me comforted me and made sure I arrived safely in Agra. It was one of the worst days of my life.",Touching /Groping

"I was walking down the 15th  main and just turned into the 16th cross in HSR layout sector 4 when I heard the sound of a scooter behind me.  So I moved to the left hand side of the road.  That particularly short stretch is a little dark as there are no houses on either side of the road and the trees are tall and thickly grown hiding the light from the street lamp.  After a couple of minutes I realised that the scooter hadn't overtaken me, just as I realised this and turned my head to see the scooter rider put out his left hand and grabbed my right breast.  I was wearing a thick sweater because it was late January and cold in the evening.  Even so I felt completely violated and screamed out an abuse. Fortunately the sound actually came from my throat.  When I realised that I shouted again.  He had grabbed my breast and taken off immediately but when he heard me abuse him loudly he stopped and turned and made as if to return, but at that moment a young man turned the corner and I think that made him take off fast.  I thought he would turn and get on to the 17th cross so I turned and went on to that road but he just disappeared.  I can still remember vaguely his face and the fact that he was on an old scooter - vespa or lambretta - and was wearing a jacket. For more than a month I was scared everytime I walked on the road and heard a vehicle behind me.  However, gradually with the support of friends and family and through prayer I overcame that.  I am a Professor, I train people to report crimes, to resist, to fight gender discrimination and all that and here was I a middle aged woman perceived to be strong and confident shattered by an incident like that.  It wasn't the first time but something like that had happened after a long time, I had let my guard down as I was on sabbatical at that time and rarely went out.  I didn't report to the police as I was I didn't know what I would tell them - no vehicle number, no definite description of the criminal.
